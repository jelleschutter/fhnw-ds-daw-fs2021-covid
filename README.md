[![Open in Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jelleschutter/fhnw-ds-daw-fs2021-covid/blob/main/data_pipeline.ipynb)

This Mini-Challenge was completed as part of the "Data Wrangling" course. We were tasked with building a data pipeline which create two clean data frames with the following daily data:
- per country (Global)
  - new cases
  - total cases
  - new deaths
  - total deaths
- per canton from start of 2nd wave (Switzerland)
  - new cases since 1st of june
  - total cases since 1st of june
  - new deaths since 1st of june
  - total deaths since 1st of june

We were only allowed to use the raw data provided by the following to institutions on GitHub:
- John Hopkins University (Global) - https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports
- Canton of Zurich (Switzerland) - https://github.com/openZH/covid_19/blob/master/COVID19_Fallzahlen_CH_total_v2.csv
